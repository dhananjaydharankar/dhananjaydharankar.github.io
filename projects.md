## Microsoft

* [Azure Storage Inventory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/blob-inventory): Azure Storage Inventory provides an overview of your data within a storage account. Use the inventory report to understand your total data size, age, encryption status, and so on. The report provides an overview of your data for business and compliance requirements.

* Azure Storage Tasks: A framework for large-scale execution of common operations on data objects.

## IBM

* [Screenshot Analysis](https://bit.ly/screenShot): From screenshot of error, it identifies OS, application and error message, using object detection, feature
extraction and text recognition models. These can be used to search knowledge base for solutions

## ML

* Video Frame Interpolation: [Masters Thesis Research Project]. This model generates new frames in videos, using deep learning, convolutional networks, depth mapss and
optical flow. Useful to create slow-mo videos, increase frame rate or recover frames lost in transmission

* [Real time vehicle tracking using drones](https://bit.ly/objectTracking): A deep learning model that uses convolutional networks and image segmentation
to detect cars in frames, and optical flow model to track cars across frames.

* 'People you may know' feature in social networks: Predict future connections in networks based on network topology features.
Achieves state-of-art accuracy on Twitter graph
