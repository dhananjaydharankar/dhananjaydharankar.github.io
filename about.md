I am Dhananjay, a software engineer interested in large scale distributed systems and machine learning.

At [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), I am working on [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/) in the Storage Management space, working at the scale of petabytes of data, building distributed, scalable and fault-tolerant systems for large scale data management operations. I have also worked on many deep learning projects related to *computer vision*, *natural language processing* and *text*, as an intern at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/) and as a student at [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/).

I am an avid football and cricket fan, I like to read sci-fi/fantasy, and I am trying to learn to play the guitar.
